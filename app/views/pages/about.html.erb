  <div class="item item--2"><p>With over a decade of development experience in a 
  number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between 
  clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to 
  clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails 
  to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p><p>For this reason I 
  decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on 
  highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a 
  project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's 
  specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly 
  with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p></div>
